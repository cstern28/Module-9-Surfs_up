# Module-9-Surfs_up

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to use SQLlite, Jupyter notebook, and Python to obtain the temperatures for December and June to determine whether a surf an ice cream shop business is sustainable to bring in profits all year long.

## Results
### Major Points from the Analysis
1. The average temperature in the month of June is 74.9 degrees.
2. The average temperature in the month of June is 71.0 degrees.
3. It appears the weather is cooler towards the end of the year, so it's important to learn whether potential customers will buy icecream and surf when the weather is slightly cooler.

## Summary
Refer to the following table below for the average statistics for June.

I would perform two additional queries by gathering data on surfer's eating and hobby habits to determine whether the surf and ice cream shop is a good fit year-round. For example, after obtaining more data, I would create a query to find out whether surfer's snacked on cold desserts as a snack during slightly cooler weather or only when it's above a certain hotter temperature. In addition, I would create a query to determine whether surfer's own thicker millimeter wetsuits to comfortably surf in cooler temperatures.
